# History

I came across about Xposed about an year ago when I searched for a post-boot Android OS customizations. So I created an open source project called NightWing[DC comics fan :)]

# What it contains?

This project basically contains some OS level framework tweaks for API 19,20,21,22 etc. Basically it has
1. Blocks user to make calls,messages,bluetooth access etc,.[Both incoming requests also]
2. Hides unwanted apps from UI drawer. Hides Google search bar.
3. Replaces stock menu icon.
4. Blocks app opening and execution.[Even it is superuser app]/This is customizable.
5. Blocks installation particular apps from Playstore[This is some sort of hard hack.]
6. Blocks app notifications
7. And more...
Basically this module turns a device into a kiosk mode with more efficiently. 

__**I Have deprecated this project because of lack of time and planned to manage it in my private.You can ping me for any further assistance from this project.**__
